Of course. Here is a message you can send to the Replit AI assistant.

Hello, I need help fixing my Node.js project.

My application uses Puppeteer to generate heatmaps, but it's failing. The API endpoint returns a `200 OK` status with a tiny 1x1 pixel image instead of a real heatmap.

The logs show the root cause is a fatal error when trying to launch the browser:
**`Error: Failed to launch the browser process! ... error while loading shared libraries: libglib-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`**

There are two issues to fix:

### \#\# 1. Missing System Dependencies

The Replit environment is missing the system packages required for Puppeteer to run. Please update the **`.replit`** file to include the necessary Nix packages.

Here is the correct configuration:

```toml
[nix]
channel = "stable-23_11"

[[pins]]
# For Puppeteer
package = "pkgs.chromium"
[[pins]]
package = "pkgs.glib" 
[[pins]]
package = "pkgs.nss"
[[pins]]
package = "pkgs.fontconfig"
[[pins]]
package = "pkgs.freetype"

# For node-canvas
[[pins]]
package = "pkgs.cairo"
[[pins]]
package = "pkgs.pango"
[[pins]]
package = "pkgs.libjpeg"
[[pins]]
package = "pkgs.giflib"
[[pins]]
package = "pkgs.librsvg"
```

### \#\# 2. Incorrect Error Handling

The API route in **`server.js`** is not handling the error correctly. It's returning a `200 OK` even when the heatmap generation fails.

Please wrap the logic in the `/api/v1/heatmap` route handler in a `try...catch` block. If an error is caught, the server should log it and respond with a `500 Internal Server Error` status and a JSON error message.

Hereâ€™s an example of how it should look:

```javascript
app.post('/api/v1/heatmap', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // ... existing heatmap generation logic ...
    const imageBuffer = await generator.generateAiHeatmap(url);
    res.status(200).json({ /* success payload */ });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Heatmap generation failed:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to generate heatmap.", details: error.message });
  }
});
```

Thank you\!
